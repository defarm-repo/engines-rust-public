# SSH Key v2 Test

This test file verifies the new SSH key (v2) works correctly with GitHub Actions.

Test timestamp: 2025-11-05 15:45 UTC

Expected behavior:
✅ GitHub Actions workflow triggers on push
✅ Workflow uses new DEPLOY_KEY_PRIVATE secret
✅ SSH authentication succeeds (no libcrypto error)
✅ Filtered code syncs to public repository
✅ This file should NOT appear in public repo (all .txt/.md files excluded)

If you see this file in the public repository, the filtering is not working correctly.
